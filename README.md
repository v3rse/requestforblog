RequestForBlog (RFB)
===

This is a platform that will allow people to request for a blog post they would like to be written. Memebers of the community can discuss the topic and also post responses to the request in the form of links to the topics.

Upvoting and downvotting of response will be a greate feature to add to this. This will gamify things a bit.

Possible  __tech stack__ :
-Meteor
-MERN

Stretch feature: track hashtag `#requestforblog` and generate request.
